  <h1>Ollert - 6 Months Later</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Tue, Dec 2, 2014</span>
      <p><a href="/blog/2014/03/17/sep-startup-weekend-ollert">Nine months ago</a> I brought a team of 6 together to build a data analysis tool called <a href="https://ollertapp.com">Ollert</a>. <a href="/blog/2014/07/13/ollert-reveal-the-data-behind-your-trello-boards">A few months later</a>, I started working with <a href="//sep.com">SEP</a> to find time to make Ollert better. Where do we stand today?</p>

<p>From a traffic perspective, we&rsquo;re doing pretty well. The numbers are increasing steadily over time, as are the number of people who use the application on a near-daily basis. Although we have surpassed our modest initial goals, we would like to build up a larger audience in the coming months.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve had about 1800 different users visit the site for a total of over 5000 pageviews. On average, users hit about 2 pages per visit and stay with us for almost 90 seconds at a time. About half of all traffic comes from social media such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and Reddit, but we&rsquo;ve also seen some interesting traffic patterns come out of Trello, <a href="/">my blog</a>, <a href="//sep.com/labs">SEP Labs</a>, and various other blogs.</p>

<p><a href="//trello.com">Trello</a> reached out to us a few months ago to congratulate us on making such a neat application using their API. They sent us some shirts and stickers for our trouble. It was an extremely satisfying moment.</p>

<p>On the technical side of things, we&rsquo;ve made several changes to the application.</p>

<p>We removed the concept of &ldquo;signing up&rdquo; for Ollert, as it was the greatest cause of confusion on the site. I replaced it with a mechanism that &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; signs a user up when they connect to a Trello account using OAuth. This makes our lives easier because we don&rsquo;t have to store passwords, and the lives of users easier because they don&rsquo;t have to come up with and remember another password.</p>

<p>Every aspect of the site has been made faster. Server requests have been made faster by switching to unicorn and utilizing the &ldquo;workers&rdquo; feature. Trello API call times have been slashed - Board fetch time dropped from 1.8s to .18s, Label chart 17.6s down to .426s, WIP chart 18.2s to .221s, CFD 15s to 1s.</p>

<p>We added two highly-requested charts - the Burn Down and Burn Up. It takes a certain type of Trello board to make these useful, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to finding someone one day who&rsquo;s able to make good use of them.</p>

<p>We also improved the look of all pages (most notably the home page) with some help from SEP&rsquo;s UX team.</p>

<p>Oh, and now it works significantly better on mobile.</p>

<p>What does the future hold for Ollert?</p>

<p>In the short term I&rsquo;m looking to implement a Cycle Time chart and add in a baseline for the Burndown chart. Long-term is a little less clear, but we may have a sizable announcement soon.</p>
