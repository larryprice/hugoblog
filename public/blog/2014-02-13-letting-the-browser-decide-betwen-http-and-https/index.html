  <h1>Letting the Browser Decide Betwen HTTP and HTTPS</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Thu, Feb 13, 2014</span>
      <p>While working on SEP Labs&rsquo; <a href="//h2w.cc">Health2Wealth</a> app, I got my first taste of setting up a website to use secure connections. I&rsquo;ve been using the browser extension <a href="//www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> for quite some time now, so all of the web pages that I visit attempt to using <code>HTTPS</code>instead of the standard <code>HTTP</code>. When I inadvertently started testing our app with <code>HTTPS</code>, things got a little weird.</p>

<p>My machine was able to open most of a page, but it wouldn&rsquo;t load some of the graphics or javascript we had embedded in the page. I was the only one able to reproduce it, so we chalked it up to a wonky machine. Then I suddenly remembered that I was using HTTPS Everywhere. I found the area in FireFox that warns you about insecure connections and found that our page was only <em>partially</em> loading on my browser because some of the content was insecure. From there I enabled an option to reveal the insecure elements, which forced my page to load everything correctly. So now we needed to find what was insecure about our page. I trekked through the codebase and found that some of our graphs and links were hard-coded to use <code>HTTP</code>. My initial thought was just to force them to use <code>HTTPS</code>, which is <a href="//lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2013OctDec/0625.html">almost certainly the impending standard</a>. With a quick search, I found that there exists a <strong>real</strong> solution to this problem.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I have a very normal web application, so I want to include <a href="//jquery.com">jQuery</a> embedded in my page. I initially copy-paste <code>&lt;script src='http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> right into my <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> node, which normally seems fine. Unfortunately, this is where issues arise. I&rsquo;m now forcing the user to make a connection which may or may not be secure to fetch data from an insecure page.</p>

<p>By removing the <code>http:</code> from the <code>http://</code>, the issue of deciding whether to fetch the file using <code>HTTP</code> or <code>HTTPS</code> is left to the web browser. So my script include becomes <code>&lt;script src='//code.jquery.com/jquery.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>. This also works for links, images, and web fonts. In fact, every link included in this post uses the same principal, where I leave the protocol out of what becomes the <code>href</code> tag.</p>

  <script>document.write('<script src="http://'
        + (location.host || 'localhost').split(':')[0]
		+ ':1313/livereload.js?mindelay=10"></'
        + 'script>')</script></body>
