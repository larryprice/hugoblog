<strong>Chad Fowler</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>###The Gist###</p>

<p>This book tells the story of Chad Fowler (no relation to <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a>). Fowler got himself into a software development slump and was able to turn it around and rejuvinate his passion for his career. Much of the book revolves around how to keep oneself engaged with one&rsquo;s work and how to determine when it&rsquo;s time to shake things up.</p>

<p>###My Feelings###</p>

<p>I read this book in Summer 2012 and did a mediocre write-up on my old blog, so I&rsquo;ve decided to quickly redo the write-up from scratch using my new format.</p>

<p>What Fowler talks about in his book is exactly what I was afraid of when looking for a job last fall: getting stuck. It&rsquo;s easy to do: many employers are looking for employees who are willing to work on projects throughout their entire lifespan, which may be 12 months, 5 years or in some cases the lifespan of the company.</p>

<p>Personal story time. I was offered a job at an Indianapolis company with many long-term projects. One of my interviewers had been working on his current project for 5 years, and was trying desparately to get out of it. However, based on his seniority and domain knowledge of the project, he was told it would be at least another 6 months before he could move on. The developer was miserable working his current job and had no exit routes available to him, which scared me quite a bit.</p>

<p>Fowler&rsquo;s methods don&rsquo;t describe how to avoid this situation. They describe how to keep yourself happy by learning new technology and branching away from your &ldquo;domain knowledge&rdquo; while still remaining the go-to guy on your current project. Showing an interest in doing things outside of your current project should show an employer that you&rsquo;re capable of more, and that you&rsquo;re more than willing to do something new.</p>

<p>Fowler also talks about moving jobs if you&rsquo;re unhappy, noting that the new world of software development doesn&rsquo;t offer all the bells and whistles that it used to. Although I agree that you should try to find a new job if you&rsquo;re unhappy, it&rsquo;s not always as easy to pack up your things and move as the author makes it seem.</p>

<p>The coolest parts of the book were the personal stories of several high-tech big-wigs. The silliest parts were the &lsquo;Act On It&rsquo; sections. The &lsquo;Act On It&rsquo; sections described how to implement some of the methods detailed in the book, but they often seemed obvious and unnecessary to me.</p>

<p>###Who Would Like This###</p>

<p>This book can offer a lot to someone who wants to revitalize their career after getting in a rut. It may also be able to serve as a guide to preventing yourself from getting in a rut. As a recent college grad with many of my dreams still alive, I only found a moderate amount of honey in this beehive. An interesting read, but maybe not entirely relevant to fresh faces.</p>
