      <p>###The Gist</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321334876/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321334876&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=larpriandthee-20"><em>Effective C++</em></a> is a list of ways to write not-your-average-bear C++ code. The author, <a href="http://www.aristeia.com/">Scott Meyers</a>, outlines 8 specific topics for improving code, and a few more miscellaneous tips.</p>

<p>###My Opinion</p>

<p>Lots of good can come from reading this book. I borrowed it from a more-experienced co-worker and noticed many of the interesting coding standards this co-worker used came directly from this book. And I agree with it. I&rsquo;ve been actively trying to follow the lessons learned in this book from the moment I picked it up.</p>

<p>I learned C++ the hard way: I was thrown into an internship where I didn&rsquo;t really have enough skills to contribute to the project, and my &ldquo;boss&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t really have anywhere to put me. So I was handed a book, pointed to <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">this wonderous website</a>, and I wrote some little helper apps for the project. I wasn&rsquo;t taught anything about form or any of that formal business. Then I took a C++ class in college, and never bothered to learn any of the coding standards because I had enough previous knowledge to get by my own way (and appear to be really good while doing it).</p>

<p>So this book showed me a lot of the why certain things in C++ are the way they are. It explained to me that a copy constructor is called every time you pass an object directly through a function, and how assignment operators are used whenever an equals sign appears. It told me why my destructors need to be virtual. It explained a lot about smart_ptr and auto_ptr that I never thought to think about.</p>

<p>Admittedly, there are parts of the book that are hard to follow. I consider Chapter 7 (Templates and Generic Programming) and Chapter 8 (Customizing new and delete) to be extremely technical chapters not meant for the faint of heart, and the lessons learned in these chapters are not necessarily useful in day-to-day programming. Chapter 9 is simply called Miscellany, and it delivers no new information for improving one&rsquo;s C++ skills.</p>

<p>###Who Would Like This</p>

<p>C++ Programmers should have this book (at least the first 6 chapters) crammed down their throats and into their squishy pink brains. After learning all the &ldquo;basic&rdquo; concepts of C++, the lessons this book teaches in design and the nature of C++ should be taken into consideration.</p>
