  <h1>The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Sun, Aug 31, 2014</span>
      <p>###The Idea</p>

<p>Everyone lies. Everyone cheats. From Marcy down the street cheating on her diet to Bernie Madoff committing massive finanical fraud, we&rsquo;re all a little dishonest from time to time. With the power of experimentats and research, Dan Ariely seeks to learn what leads humans to act dishonestly in <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1qsOgTy">The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty</a></em>.</p>

<p>###The Gooey Center</p>

<p>Since reading <em><a href="http://amzn.to/VYzVTZ">Predictably Irrational</a></em> earlier this year, I&rsquo;ve really liked reading Dan Ariely; his writing style is familiar yet authoritative, making for highly readable books filled with high-quality experiments and meaningful insights. <em>The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty</em> is a similar read to <em>Predictably Irrational</em>, but with a tight focus on what drives the common man to lie and cheat.</p>

<p>The main takeaway is, given the chance, most people will cheat just a little given the opportunity. Ariely&rsquo;s experiments found that very few people cheated heavily, even in situations where the likelihood of being caught is minimal. Rounding up your billable hours on a timesheet is easy to do without a shred of guilt, and the likelihood of getting caught is approximately nil. On the other hand, fudging an hour or two in a single day is not something anyone I know would take lightly. Unfortunately, if you round up billable hours by 10 minutes a day for a whole week, you&rsquo;ve fudged nearly an hour of billable work (without the guilt).</p>

<p>Day-to-day living makes us less honest. If you&rsquo;ve had a long day at work, you&rsquo;re more likely to cheat on your diet when you get home because your defenses have been torn down. You&rsquo;re more likely to put things off in favor of sitting around watching television.</p>

<p>Ariely finds that collaboration also leads to more dishonesty: as humans, we are more willing to bend the rules if it will benefit someone else, especially if we have befriended that someone else.</p>

<p>###Who Would Like This</p>

<p>Those interested in behavioral economics should get a kick out of this book, especially if they enjoyed Ariely&rsquo;s other works. Reading this book can also make you think more critically about some of the &ldquo;little white lies&rdquo; you tell yourself and others throught the day.</p>
