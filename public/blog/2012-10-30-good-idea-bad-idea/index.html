  <h1>Good Idea, Bad Idea</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Tue, Oct 30, 2012</span>
      <p>There is a general, unnamed rule when coming up with ideas:</p>

<p><strong><em>A person is required to have one or more bad ideas before having a single good idea</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Since this rule is unnamed, it shall henceforth be referred to as Larry&rsquo;s Law.</p>

<p>Note that the thinker in question is not limited to just one bad idea under Larry&rsquo;s Law, but as many as he so desires. Also note that Larry&rsquo;s Law does not imply that the thinker will necessarily ever have any good ideas.</p>

<p>Having bad ideas is necessary. Bad ideas let the brain see what it shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking about, which has the potential to lead to good ideas. Then again, many bad ideas may just spawn more bad ideas. That&rsquo;s just Larry&rsquo;s Law.</p>

<p>###Examples###</p>

<p>You sit down at your desk and pick up a bug. Your first idea doesn&rsquo;t fix the code. Your second idea doesn&rsquo;t compile. Your third idea breaks all 3400 unit tests in the test suite. Your fourth idea is a complete hack. Your fifth idea breaks some other component of the application. Your sixth idea seems genius to you but doesn&rsquo;t survive the code review. Your seventh idea is a winner.</p>

<p>Before Edison could invent the <a href="http://edison.rutgers.edu/ticker.htm">Universal Stock Ticker</a>, he had to invent a <a href="http://edison.rutgers.edu/vote.htm">crummy vote recorder</a>.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea the number of albums Pink Floyd released before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon"><em>The Dark Side of the Moon</em></a>? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd_discography">Seven</a>. Don&rsquo;t kid yourself: these seven albums were not gems. But don&rsquo;t fret! Larry&rsquo;s Law states that these albums had to be low quality to allow <em>The Dark Side of the Moon</em> to be a monumental album.</p>

<p>Someone invented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_coke">New Coke</a>. This is an instance of someone making a bad decision without any corresponding good decisions.</p>

<p>Domino&rsquo;s pizza was <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/culture/pizza-turnaround-dominos-pizza-knows-they-suck-2555951.html">terrible</a> until very recently. Now it&rsquo;s delicious, at least according to <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110609112806AABnOTo">this man on Yahoo! Answers</a>.</p>

<p>A group of people wants to go out to eat. Jon Doe will suggest Jimmy John&rsquo;s, then Penn Station, McDonald&rsquo;s, Five Guys, Taco Bell, and Denny&rsquo;s. Finally Jon Doe offers a reasonable idea, like YATS. This process will now be repeated by every person in the group, and the best decision will never become visible. And Larry&rsquo;s Law specifies that the group may never come to a good decision, and will probably end up eating at Five Guys.</p>

<p>###Conclusion###</p>

<p>The next time you have a bad idea, embrace it. Realize that having that bad idea might clear space in your head for a good idea. Or possibly an infinite number of bad ideas. Either way, that&rsquo;s just Larry&rsquo;s Law.</p>
