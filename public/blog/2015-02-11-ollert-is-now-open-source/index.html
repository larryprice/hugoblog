  <h1>Ollert is now open source</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Wed, Feb 11, 2015</span>
      

<p><a href="https://ollertapp.com">Ollert</a>, the Trello data analytics tool, has been open sourced under <a href="https://github.com/sep/ollert/blob/master/LICENSE">GNU Affero GPL v3.0</a>. The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/sep/ollert/">on Github</a> and I&rsquo;ve already accepted several pull requests.</p>

<h4 id="why:91a8505ce7232e3372e61c9b8f758bab">Why?</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working towards this for a few months now. Although Ollert was a lot of fun to create and has helped quite a few people learn more about their Trello boards, I&rsquo;ve been having trouble finding the time to write new features in between my other pursuits. Although <a href="http://www.sep.com/">SEP</a> has given me resources in the past, it&rsquo;s not always easy to find people off-project who have the right experience, determination, and time to grok the codebase and start churning out new features.</p>

<p>An interesting pattern started to appear: With every other feature request I received for Ollert, the requestor would add in some other loaded question: Where is the source code? Is there a Github repo so I can add issues? Do you accept pull requests?</p>

<p>Random strangers on the internet wanted to help. These are people with the drive to work with me even though I couldn&rsquo;t give them anything in return. These are people with fresh perspectives on Trello usage which I had never imagined. These are the developers whose help I sorely wanted.</p>

<h4 id="feature-requests:91a8505ce7232e3372e61c9b8f758bab">Feature requests?</h4>

<p>I am still accepting feature requests. Feature requests are now dealt with through our <a href="https://github.com/sep/ollert/issues">issues page</a>.</p>

<h4 id="contributing:91a8505ce7232e3372e61c9b8f758bab">Contributing?</h4>

<ul>
<li>Write tests</li>
<li>Run tests</li>
<li>Seriously, the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/sep/ollert">travis-ci build</a> had better be green.</li>
<li>Follow the currently in-place patterns. If you don&rsquo;t like them, let me know your idea before you work for a week and I deny your changes.</li>
<li>Create issues for whatever you&rsquo;re working on.</li>
<li>We do things by pull requests. Make a fork, make a branch, let Github do the rest.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="and-so-it-continues:91a8505ce7232e3372e61c9b8f758bab">And so, it continues&hellip;</h4>

<p>This does not mean I am abandoning Ollert. Internally we&rsquo;ll still be discussing how to increase traffic and improve user experience. Hopefully, open sourcing Ollert will give us invaluable feedback on the code and fresh perspectives on features. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the future of Ollert.</p>
