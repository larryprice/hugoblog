  <h1>Custom Domain with Github Pages</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Wed, Feb 12, 2014</span>
      <p>As of today, I&rsquo;m the proud owner of <a href="//larry-price.com">larry-price.com</a>. On the recommendation from a friend, I used <a href="//domainmonster.com">domainmonster.com</a> for it&rsquo;s cost effectiveness and usable toolset. I wanted to link my Github Pages blog (this blog!) to my new site. In case I ever want to do this again, I&rsquo;ve provided myself (and you!) with a step-by-step guide below. Note that Github <a href="//help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages">has a page that explains how to do this</a>, but there&rsquo;s some fluff and ordering issues that turned me off from using those instructions as any more than a reference.</p>

<p>####Step 0: Buy your domain####</p>

<p>All sites where you can purchase domains have the same domains available, but at different prices. From the sites I perused, <a href="//godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a> had the best search for domain names, suggesting different variations on the searched domain name. I found that <a href="//domainmonster.com">domainmonster.com</a> had the ugliest UI but the best prices. <a href="//hover.com">Hover.com</a> looked really modern and had moderate prices. Shop around and spend money.</p>

<p>####Step 0.5: Exercise restraint####</p>

<p>At this point in the process, <strong>don&rsquo;t go to your site</strong>.</p>

<p>My guess is you already have. If you don&rsquo;t have the ability to go back in time, don&rsquo;t sweat it, just know that you probably won&rsquo;t be able to verify the fruits of your labor for a few hours.</p>

<p>####Step 1: Setting up an &lsquo;A Record&rsquo;####</p>

<p>Find the ip address where your site is currently hosted. For me (replace URL with your own):</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ nslookup larryprice.github.io
Server:   127.0.1.1
Address:  127.0.1.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name: larryprice.github.io
Address: 199.27.74.133
</code></pre>

<p>You should be able to &ldquo;manage&rdquo; your domain on your domain provider&rsquo;s website. In the &ldquo;management&rdquo; area, you should be able to find a section about &ldquo;DNS&rdquo;. Find something labeled &ldquo;A records.&rdquo; There will likely already be one or two entries here - one for the IP address of your new domain and one with the IP address of your domain with &ldquo;www.&rdquo; prepended.</p>

<p>Modify the entry (or entries) with the IP address found using <code>nslookup</code> (&ldquo;199.27.74.133&rdquo; from the example above). Save your site settings.</p>

<p>####Step 2: Mucking with the &ldquo;www&rdquo; instance####</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;re modifying these settings, we might as well move the &lsquo;www&rsquo; case out of the &ldquo;A records&rdquo;. Go ahead and delete it.</p>

<p>Look for something named &ldquo;CNAME records&rdquo;, or figure out how to add records in general. We&rsquo;re going to add a CNAME record where the &ldquo;Alias&rdquo; is &ldquo;www&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Address&rdquo; is your site&rsquo;s name. In my case, my &ldquo;Alias&rdquo; field is &ldquo;www&rdquo; and my &ldquo;Address&rdquo; field is &ldquo;larry-price.com&rdquo;. Add the record and cross your fingers for success.</p>

<p>####Step 3: Telling Github Pages what to do####</p>

<p>Alhtough Github Pages is magical in its own right, it doesn&rsquo;t know what to do when receiving a request from the &ldquo;A record&rdquo; we created in Step 2 without further instruction.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using Github Pages for a user page, we are going to make this change on the <code>master</code> branch. If this is a project page, do it on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p>

<p>All we have to do is put our new domain into a file in the root folder called <code>CNAME</code>. Let&rsquo;s do it in one fell swoop of the command line.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ echo &quot;larry-price.com&quot; &gt; CNAME 
</code></pre>

<p>Push that to Github and wait 0 to 10 minutes for Github to refresh your page.</p>

<p>Note: If you&rsquo;re one of the few, the proud using the brilliant <a href="//octopress.org/">Octopress</a> to generate your blog, you want to make sure to add the <code>CNAME</code> file to the root of your <code>source/</code> directory. That way, when you call <code>deploy</code> your <code>CNAME</code> file will end up in the root of your <code>_deploy</code> directory.</p>

<p>####Step 4: Behold####</p>

<p>Check your Github repository&rsquo;s &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; section. In the &ldquo;GitHub Pages&rdquo; section, you should now see something along the lines of &ldquo;Your site is published at <a href="http://larry-price.com&quot;">http://larry-price.com&quot;</a>. Go, young one, and visit your new site; and behold the glory you have brought to your family.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll note that this is the point where not obeying Step 0.5 will cause issues. Once your internets knows that your page hit a certain DNS, it takes a few hours to refresh. In my case it only took about 2 hours, but it may take between 12 and 48 hours to refresh. A workaround to see if everything is working is to pull out your smart phone and use your carrier&rsquo;s network to check your new site, since that area of the internets is probably still untainted. (All of this paragraph is a simplified thought process on how DNS works, considering that&rsquo;s the level I understand it.)</p>

<p>Now fly, my children, and spread yourself over the internet with dozens of silly domain names!</p>
